# Second-order thinking

## Decision Making

Consider the long-term consequences of your decisions.

## Problem

Some decisions seem like wins at first, but turn out to be losses over time. What seems like an investment now turns out to be a liability later. What looked like a good decision earlier is now a bad one.

## Solution

Use second-order thinking to examine the long-term effects of your decisions. Most people stop at first-order thinking, but second-order thinking helps you make decisions that will stand the test of time.

## How to use it

Using second-order thinking can be a purely mental exercise or you can write it down on paper.

1. Consider a decision you have to make
2. Look at the immediate effects (first order)
3. For each effect, ask "And then what?" to examine second-order consequences
4. Repeat for additional orders as needed

Alternatively, think about the consequences in different timelines:

- 10 minutes
- 10 months
- 10 years

This helps you consider short-term, medium-term and long-term impacts.

You can apply second-order thinking to both big decisions (e.g. buying a house) and small, everyday choices (e.g. eating a cake). It's useful for personal decisions, business strategy, and policy-making.

## Example

Let's explore what second-order thinking looks like with the decision of buying a house outside the city.

Immediate (first-order) effects:

- Having a garden
- More space for family
- Living an hour from work

Higher-order consequences:

- Having a garden → able to grow produce → having fresh herbs and vegetables
- More space for family → more rooms to clean → more stress from a messy home
- Living an hour from work → need to buy a car → spending two hours daily commuting

This example shows just some consequences, but demonstrates how second-order thinking reveals longer-term impacts to make more informed decisions.
