# Confidence determines speed vs. quality

## Decision Making

Determine a trade-off between speed and quality when building products.

## Problem

In product development, speed and quality are two important variables. Prioritizing one is typically at the expense of the other.

## Solution

Base your decision to prioritize speed or quality on your confidence in:

- The importance of the problem you're solving
- The correctness of your solution to that problem

Before making this decision, ensure your confidence is based on data rather than subjective views.

## How to use it

There are three basic scenarios:

1. Low confidence in problem importance → Focus on speed
2. High confidence in both problem and solution → Focus on quality
3. High confidence in problem but low in solution → Balance speed and quality

Note that confidence exists on a spectrum rather than being binary. Your approach should be similarly nuanced based on your specific confidence levels.
